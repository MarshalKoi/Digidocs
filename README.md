Digidocs website frontend.  
You can check out the backend and the models here: https://github.com/MarshalKoi/PPstructure_FastAPI

**NOTE 1:** This is ONLY the front-end. If you don't care how it looks, you should try using the Docker backend to see how the model performs and how to use the APIs.

**NOTE 2:** I am NOT going to spend money for a server to deploy the model so you can test it.

**NOTE 3:** The model is quite big, and the idea of the project is to utilize backend servers and APIs to allow the use of bigger models which provide more accuracy compared to lightweight models for edge devices. This comes with the drawback of higher server cost.

**NOTE 4:** Realistically speaking, this will only serve accuracy-critical tasks. It is not economical to shoulder the server costâ€”edge device deployment and decentralizing the compute needs is the better option.
