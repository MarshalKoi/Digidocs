You can check out the backend and the models here: https://github.com/MarshalKoi/PPstructure_FastAPI

# NOTE 1: This is ONLY the front-end if you don't care how it looks you should try using the Docker backend to see how the model performs and how to use the APIs.
# NOTE 2: I am NOT going to spend money for a server to deploy the model so you can test it.
# NOTE 3: The model is quite big and the idea of the project is to ustilize Backend servers and API to allow the use of bigger models which provide more accuracy compared to lightweight models for edge devices, this come with the draw back of higher server cost. 
# NOTE 4: Realistically speaking this will only serve accuracy critical tasks it is not economical to shoulder the server cost, edge device deployment and decentralising the compute needs is the better option.
